<!-- Format restrictions - see https://common-changelog.org and https://keepachangelog.com/ for details -->
<!-- Each Release must start with a line for the release version of exactly this format: ## [version] -->
<!-- The subsequent comment lines start with a space - not to irritate the release scripts parser!

 !!! In addition the compare URL links are to be maintained at the end of this CHANGELOG.md as follows.
     These links provide direct access to the GitHub compare vs. the previous release.
     The particular link of a released version will be copied to the release notes of a release accordingly.
     At the end of this file appropriate compare links have to be maintained for each release version in format:
 
  +-current release version
  |
  |                   +-URL to this repo              previous release version tag-+       +-current release version tag
  |                   |                                                            |       |
